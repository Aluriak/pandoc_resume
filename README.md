### Short version
In order to maintain easily two versions, one long and one short,
of the resume, a marker can be added at the very end to lines in `resume.md`. Any line tagged this way will not appear in the automatically
generated short version of the resume.

The short resume and consequent compiled files is stored under `short_resume.md` and similar.

The file `long_marker` contains the tag used to mark lines
of the long version. Note that this tag is expressed as a regex, and its default value is `[LONG]`.
